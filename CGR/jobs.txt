- I need to figure out how to set materials to a mesh and then how to set the uniforms on it (NIGHTMARE)
- I needs to figure out how to instance duplicate meshes. Especially in sponza. And what about the shaders -_- I dont want to write new shaders that
  do the same thing.
- fog
- picking
- waving grasss
- Need to bring back shadows and bump mapping with all the new stuff
- Do a deferred scene (without shadows)
- Do an indoor doom like level with some game logic
- Rebuild Framebuffer objects on window size change
- Outdoor terrain scene (forward rendererd)
- Deferred scene
- Refactor all shaders and tidy up
- Octree
- Frustum culling
- Some better debugging stuff
- Collsions for examples
- Animation
	
Done
	- need to optimize shaders with uniform blocks
